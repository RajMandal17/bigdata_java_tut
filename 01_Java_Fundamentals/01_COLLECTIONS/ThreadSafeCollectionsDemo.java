/*
 * Synchronized vs Concurrent Collections in Java
 *
 * 1. Synchronized Collections:
 *    - Synchronized collections are wrappers around standard collections (like ArrayList, HashMap) that add basic thread safety.
 *    - All methods are synchronized, so only one thread can access a method at a time.
 *    - Simple to use but can become a bottleneck in high-concurrency scenarios.
 *
 *    Example:
 *    // Synchronized List
 *    List<Integer> syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
 *    syncList.add(1);
 *    // To iterate safely:
 *    synchronized(syncList) {
 *        for (Integer i : syncList) {
 *            System.out.println(i);
 *        }
 *    }
 *
 *    // Synchronized Map
 *    Map<String, Integer> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
 *    syncMap.put("a", 1);
 *
 * 2. Concurrent Collections:
 *    - Designed for high concurrency and better performance.
 *    - Allow multiple threads to read/write without locking the entire collection.
 *    - Examples: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, etc.
 *
 *    Example:
 *    // Concurrent Map
 *    Map<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
 *    concurrentMap.put("a", 1);
 *    // No need for explicit synchronization for most operations
 *
 *    // CopyOnWriteArrayList (good for more reads, fewer writes)
 *    List<String> cowList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
 *    cowList.add("hello");
 *    for (String s : cowList) {
 *        System.out.println(s);
 *    }
 *
 * Summary:
 *    - Use synchronized collections for simple, low-concurrency needs.
 *    - Use concurrent collections for scalable, high-performance multi-threaded applications (recommended for big data).

 * ThreadSafeCollectionsDemo.java
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Demonstrates thread-safe collections for concurrent processing in Java, crucial for big data and multi-threaded applications.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *   - Synchronized Collections: Collections.synchronizedList/Set/Map wraps standard collections for basic thread safety.
 *   - Concurrent Collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, etc., designed for high concurrency and better performance.
 *
 * Usage/Future:
 *   - Use synchronized collections for simple thread safety in low-concurrency scenarios.
 *   - Use concurrent collections for scalable, high-performance multi-threaded processing (e.g., in big data pipelines).
 *   - Always prefer concurrent collections for modern big data and analytics applications.
 *
 * Comparison:
 *   - Synchronized collections are simple but can become bottlenecks under high contention.
 *   - Concurrent collections allow more granular locking or lock-free operations, improving throughput.
 *
 * See also:
 *   - ListPerformanceDemo.java for list performance.
 *   - SetDemo.java for unique data handling.
 *   - MapDemo.java for key-value operations.
